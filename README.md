# UNFINISHED, IGNORE THIS REPO FOR NOW
# Hello,
This is just a list of all the projects that I made for The Odin Project. All of them are available for live preview

## Note
**(Currently doing a re-run of the projects as I got busy with university and other stuff, so most of the projects that are listed will be unavailable at the moment)**

**This list is currently incomplete**, but the projects will be based from The Odin Project's:
* [Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations)
* [Full stack JavaScript path](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript)

## About The Odin Project
> High quality coding education created by an Open-Source community.
  
* The Odin Project (TOP) is one of those "What I wish I had when I was learning" resources. Not everyone has access to a computer science education or the funds to attend an intensive coding school and neither of those is right for everyone anyway. This project is designed to fill in the gap for people who are trying to hack it on their own but still want a high quality education.
  
* Start learning web development with TOP for free [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/).
